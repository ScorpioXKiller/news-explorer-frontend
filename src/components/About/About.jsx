          Hi! I am Dima Gorodov, a full-stack web developer. At the moment Iâ€™m
          studying B.Sc. in Software Engineering and also looking for
          appropriate positions. I'm a very self-motivated person who always
          take any opportunity to learn new things and I always strive to
          achieve my goals.
        </p>

          I'm focused on a MERN technology stack, but also have some experience
          in other programmer languages such as: C#, C++, Java. Also I have
          knowledge in design patterns, architectural patterns and OOP.
